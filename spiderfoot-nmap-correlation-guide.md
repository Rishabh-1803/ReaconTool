# Spiderfoot & Nmap Correlation Analysis Guide

## Overview

This guide explains how **Spiderfoot** (OSINT tool) and **nmap** (network scanner) complement each other in cybersecurity reconnaissance, and how to use the interactive correlation tool to analyze their combined findings.

## Tool Comparison

### Spiderfoot (OSINT)
- **Purpose**: Open Source Intelligence gathering from publicly available sources
- **Approach**: Passive reconnaissance
- **Data Sources**: DNS records, social media, breach databases, certificate transparency logs
- **Strengths**: Wide coverage of public information, automated data collection from 200+ sources
- **Output**: Domains, subdomains, IP addresses, email addresses, technology stacks, breach data

### Nmap (Network Scanner)
- **Purpose**: Network discovery and security auditing
- **Approach**: Active reconnaissance
- **Data Sources**: Direct network probing and service enumeration
- **Strengths**: Detailed port/service information, vulnerability detection, accurate host discovery
- **Output**: Open ports, running services, operating systems, service versions, vulnerabilities

## Correlation Methodology

### 1. Direct IP Correlation
When Spiderfoot discovers IP addresses through OSINT, nmap can scan these specific targets:
- **DNS Records** → **Port Scans**: Verify which services are actually running
- **Subdomain Resolution** → **Service Discovery**: Find administrative interfaces and hidden services
- **WHOIS Data** → **Network Range Scanning**: Map the complete attack surface

### 2. Technology Stack Validation
Spiderfoot identifies technologies through passive means, nmap confirms through active probing:
- **HTTP Headers** → **Service Fingerprinting**: Confirm web server versions
- **Certificate Analysis** → **SSL/TLS Service Details**: Validate encryption implementations
- **Banner Grabbing** → **Version Verification**: Cross-reference technology versions

### 3. Risk Assessment Integration
Combining passive and active findings provides comprehensive risk evaluation:
- **Breach Data + Open Services**: Correlate exposed credentials with accessible services
- **Vulnerability Intelligence + Port Scans**: Match known CVEs with running services
- **Attack Surface Mapping**: Combine OSINT footprint with network accessibility

## Correlation Scoring Algorithm

The tool uses a weighted scoring system to determine correlation strength:

```
Correlation Score = IP_Match_Weight + Technology_Match_Weight + Risk_Level_Weight + Service_Context_Weight

Where:
- IP_Match_Weight = 0.8 (direct IP address correlation)
- Technology_Match_Weight = 0.9 (version/technology matching)
- Risk_Level_Weight = 0.3 (similar risk assessment)
- Service_Context_Weight = 0.4 (logical service relationships)
```

### Correlation Thresholds
- **Strong Correlation** (>1.0): High confidence in relationship
- **Moderate Correlation** (0.5-1.0): Likely relationship requiring validation
- **Weak Correlation** (<0.5): Potential relationship for investigation

## Best Practices

### Data Collection
1. **Sequential Approach**: Start with OSINT, then move to active scanning
2. **Scope Management**: Use OSINT findings to focus nmap scans
3. **Rate Limiting**: Avoid detection during active reconnaissance
4. **Documentation**: Maintain detailed logs of all activities

### Correlation Analysis
1. **Multi-Source Validation**: Confirm findings across multiple sources
2. **Temporal Considerations**: Account for time differences in data collection
3. **False Positive Reduction**: Implement confidence scoring
4. **Continuous Monitoring**: Regular updates to correlation algorithms

### Risk Assessment
1. **Contextual Evaluation**: Consider business impact of findings
2. **Prioritization Matrix**: Focus on high-correlation, high-risk items
3. **Remediation Planning**: Develop action plans based on correlated risks
4. **Metrics Tracking**: Monitor improvement over time

## Limitations and Considerations

### Technical Limitations
- **Data Freshness**: OSINT data may be outdated compared to real-time network scans
- **Coverage Gaps**: Not all network services may have corresponding OSINT indicators
- **False Correlations**: Automated correlation may produce spurious relationships

### Legal and Ethical Considerations
- **Authorization**: Ensure proper permission for active network scanning
- **Data Privacy**: Handle OSINT data in compliance with privacy regulations
- **Responsible Disclosure**: Report vulnerabilities through appropriate channels
- **Documentation**: Maintain audit trails for compliance purposes

## Advanced Correlation Techniques
